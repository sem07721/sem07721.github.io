<p>In "How Not to Die", a health book discussing the negative impact a poor diet can have on quality of life and lifespan, Dr. Greger provides a "Daily Dozen" checklist of the foods that all people should be eating everyday to prevent disease. You can view this list by clicking on the link below.</p>
<p> I have created a sample meal plan for three days (above) using this list for anyone concerned with how to get these 12 foods everyday. I gave examples of meals that I
eat very often to provide recommendations of healthy delicious meals that include these superfoods that prevent disease and promote overall health. As mentioned on the 
website linked below, these daily dozen include foods you should try to implement in your diet everyday.I will provide one recipe example to make it easier to implement
 this plan. To make the breakfast in example three, whole grain toast with sofritas, you will need 9 ingredients: whole grain toast, sweet bell peppers, black beans, chickpeas, firm tofu,
 salsa, taco seasoning, avocado and tomato. The first step is to saute the sweet bell peppers on a pan on medium heat. Then, after they brown slightly, you should crumble
 the tofu in the pan and allow to cook for about two minutes without touching it. Then, mix in the black beans and chickpeas and allow to cook for another two minutes.
 Next, you should add 1/8 cup of taco seasoning and three table spoons of salsa. Next, place the mixture on the toasted whole grain toast and top with half an avocado
 and some cut up tomato.

<p id="cat"><h1>Beans, Beans, They're Good for Your Heart</h1>

<p><i> Beans </i> are one of the most important foods to eat and here is why </p>
	<p><object data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLV_OSneMqU"></object></p>
	<p> To summarize the video, there are anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effect of beans due to various phytochemicals, but it also has been proven that beans may also positively impact your cardiovascular system as well. A study he mentions in the video claims that beans, “possess certain pharmacological properties in human health such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic, hypotensive, as well as prevention of aging, diabetes, osteoporosis, DNA damage, hear diseases and other disorders.”  He said that those without legumes in their diet may be at up to four times the risk of developing high blood pressure. Adding two servings of chickpeas or other legumes everyday lowered high-risk patients blood pressure so much that they were able to come off their current medication. This video explains exactly why beans are in the “daily dozen.” Dr. McGregor recommends three servings of beans every single day. I have added beans/legumes into many of the suggested meals in the table above for this reason.</p>

	<p>What are antioxidants?</p>
	
	<p>According to Medline Plus, Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Antioxidants are found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. 
	Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases. 
	Some examples of antioxidants are Beta-carotene, Lutein, Lycopene, Selenium, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E.
	From my own research and knowledge I know that some examples of foods rich in antioxidants are berries, like blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, cherries, grapes and also certain teas like Green Tea. 
	Antioxidants are necessary in the human diet to reduce free radicals and prevent disease. On this website you can view more facts about antioxidants to help you learn how to include them in your daily life.</p>
